# Tina-Croxton-Portfolio
Professional portfolio of Tina Croxton

## Description

This project was created to serve as a portfolio to show potential employers and clients in the future. It'll be a one-stop-shop so they can get to know me, gauge my skill level and decipher if I'm the right fit for their company and/or project. I wanted to create a website that can be viewed across various screen sizes without any distortion or hinderance to the viewer and creating a user-friendly experience. Throughout the process of creating this project, I learned how troubleshoot issues that may arise when using flexbox in regard to the responsiveness of the site across different screen sizes and devices; as well as the best practices for when tasked with creating a project from scratch.
